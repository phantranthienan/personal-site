# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post using **MDX** with **frontmatter** support! 

## What is Frontmatter?

Frontmatter is metadata that sits at the top of your Markdown or MDX files. It's written in YAML format and contains information about your content like:

- Title
- Description
- Publication date
- Tags
- Author information
- Publication status

## Features Included

This setup includes several useful features:

### üéØ Frontmatter Parsing
All blog posts can include YAML frontmatter that gets parsed and made available to your components.

### üìù TypeScript Support
Full TypeScript support for frontmatter data with proper type definitions.

### üè∑Ô∏è Tagging System
Organize your posts with tags and filter by them.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Reading Time Estimation
Automatic calculation of estimated reading time based on word count.

### üîç Blog Utilities
Helper functions to:
- Get all blog posts
- Filter by tags
- Sort by date
- Get featured posts

## Code Example

Here's how you can use the blog utilities:

```typescript
import { getAllBlogPosts, getBlogPostsByTag } from "@/lib/blog";

// Get all published blog posts
const posts = getAllBlogPosts();

// Get posts by specific tag
const mdxPosts = getBlogPostsByTag("mdx");
```

## What's Next?

You can now start creating your own blog posts with frontmatter. Each post should include at minimum:

- `title`: The post title
- `description`: A brief description
- `date`: Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `author`: Your name
- `published`: Whether the post should be shown publicly

Happy blogging! üéâ
